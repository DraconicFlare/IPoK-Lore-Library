The cook for [The Orthoclast Family](The%20Orthoclast%20Family.md). She was born in [Needlepit](Needlepit) in the year (gamestart-47) to one human and one devil parent. Her family was kept hidden and safe from Caelbyrn's wrath by way of the illusory magics of her father, but when Caelbyrn was slain and the tensions towards [Tartarus](Tartarus) were highest, she was sent away to [Titan](../../Locations/Titan.md) to apprentice with a distant relative. There, at age 10, she began learning her trade.

Over the years, she kept in close contact with her family at home. They'd often exchange letters, and those letters were a lifeline that Eureka clung to. Then, one day, the letters stopped. Panicking, Eureka left Titan without a word, rushing home, only to find that the reason the letters stopped was exactly as she feared: her parents were dead. Despairing, she returned to Titan and the Orthoclasts. 

When Eureka was 17, the old cook died, and she stepped up to take her teacher's place, further cementing Titan as her new home.

As time went on, the Orthoclasts had two children: Mookaite and [Spinel Orthoclast](Spinel%20Orthoclast). Spinel, being the youngest, was mostly overlooked in favor of her older brother. Seeing a child abandoned by her parents, she felt a vague kinship with Spinel. Eureka cared for her when her parents ignored her, and took her under her wing, teaching the young'un in much the same way she was taught by her predecessor.
