Spinel is the 19y/o daughter of [[The Orthoclast Family|Almondine & LeGrand Orthoclast]], second in line to the family Magistery, preceded by her brother Mookaite (or Mooky, for short). Spinel was born to wealth and given a pampered life, but was always less important than her brother. This had its perks and drawbacks. On the one hand, she received far less responsibility (due to being all but ignored most of the time), and was able to find friendship in the staff at her estate, bonding especially with the chef, [[Eureka Baker]]. On the other, she often felt trapped, destined to be married off someday for a political power grab.

Again though, it wasn't all bad. While Spinel was being mostly ignored by her parents, Eureka taught her how to hunt, how to cook, and how to fend for herself. She taught her about the outside world. As long as Spinel didn't create a scandal, her family didn't seem to really care what she did.

Up until that fateful day, that is. Spinel was told by her parents that she was set to be married off, so, she did what anyone might do when their worst fear comes true. She ran, fleeing for the nearest town and seeking a new life. Seeking adventure. Her parents should come looking for her... eventually. Once they notice she's missing. But that's a problem for future her.
