Felix was born in [Needlepit](Needlepit), the same year as the signing of the [Stromkirk-Scau Accord](Stromkirk-Scau Accord). He grew up as the city did, Zenith becoming a bustling trade city around him. His father, Lawrence Rhodes, was a Needler, but his mother, Arrogance, was a tiefling who immigrated to Needlepit during the initial trade boom.

For most of his life, Felix worked for William Rhodes & Sons Carpenters as an accountant. Their younger sibling Felicity, however, wasn't satisfied with working in a wood shop her whole life. The younger tiefling packed their bags and left home, with well-wishes sending her on her way. A few years later, she came back, tail between her legs. Felix, in order to make room for his sibling, took a lesser bookkeeping job at the [Sentinels of the Celestial Dome](../Organizations/ZeNa/Sentinels%20of%20the%20Celestial%20Dome.md) temple, and passed on some of their knowledge to Felicity.

In the time since, Felix has been doing quite well for himself at the SotCD, having risen up the ladder fairly quickly to become the [Hierarch](../NPCs/ZeNa/Hierarch%20Diam%20Goldscript.md)'s personal assistant. The only slight hitch to the plan is... Felicity isn't the best with numbers, and the family has been surreptitiously trying to reach out to Felix to come back. That'll probably come back to bite him at some point.
