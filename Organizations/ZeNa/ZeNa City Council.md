A group of officials whose role is to make wide-reaching decisions that would have effects on both cities.

There are currently seven seats on the ZeNa City Council. Each seat is kept until retirement or death. The current seats are:
- Guard Captain - Held by [Pela Ghaine](Guard Captain Pela Ghaine)
- Merchant Coalition Guildmaster - Held by [Thaddeus Gilder](Thaddeus%20Gilder)
- Mayor of Zenith - Held by [Slate Coldsteel](Slate%20Coldsteel)
- Mayor of Nadir - Held by [Lucius Olsen](Lucius%20Olsen)
- Tartaran Ambassador - Held by [Arkhai Scau](Arkhai%20Scau)
- Hierarch of the SotCD - Held by [Diam Goldscript](Hierarch Diam Goldscript)
- Voice of the Nobility - Held by [Her Ladyship the Countess Juno Astraeus](Her%20Ladyship%20the%20Countess%20Juno%20Astraeus)

Seats can be added by a unanimous vote, which is increasingly rare. Appeals are made constantly to add new seats, and usually require a large amount of voices asking for it in order for change to be made.

Due to the fact that there are not always an odd number of seats, there is a role which rotates among all members of the council called the Keeper of the Accord. This additional title allows for there to be a break in ties, leaning in the favor of the current Keeper; their vote counts for one and a half votes, or thereabouts.

Additionally, there is always one person that watches over the proceedings in the interest of informing the King of Titan as to the goings on of the city, and in the interest of ensuring fairness in all proceedings. This role is currently held by [Viceroy Roscoe Stromkirk](Viceroy%20Roscoe%20Stromkirk), and presumably should he meet an untimely death, another overseer would be sent from Titan to assume the position.
