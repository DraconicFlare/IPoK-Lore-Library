The nearest major Tartaran city to [Nadir](ZeNa.md). Drysk is made up of a multitude of stone towers, except instead of being built atop an area of level ground, the city hangs upside-down from a cavern ceiling like stalactites. The majority of the city is made up of a few massive buildings, with clusters of smaller ones surrounding. The larger buildings function as hubs, made up of a multitude of businesses and official buildings, and the smaller tend to be family homes.
