The demon proprietor of [Locar's Locus](Locar's%20Locus). He tends to be a straight shooter, hates it when people kid around with him. That's not to say he's unkind or unfriendly; he'll put you up for the night, whether or not you have enough silvers for the room. But he'll also make you clean the bar until your debt is paid. No free handouts.
