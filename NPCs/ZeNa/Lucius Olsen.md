The tiefling mayor of Nadir, and member of the [ZeNa City Council](IPoK%20Wiki/Organizations/ZeNa/ZeNa%20City%20Council.md). Very outspoken about the rights of [Tartarus](Tartarus) people, and affiliated heavily with the [[Chains of Carceri]], which has caused some trouble for him in the past; the nobility of [[ZeNa]] don't care terribly for sharing a council chamber with someone who wants their wealth redistributed to the working class.
