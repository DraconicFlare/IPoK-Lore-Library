(They/Them) The [earth genasi](../../Organizations/ZeNa/Sentinels%20of%20the%20Celestial%20Dome.md) head of the [Sentinels of the Celestial Dome](../../Organizations/ZeNa/Sentinels%20of%20the%20Celestial%20Dome.md), and member of the [ZeNa City Council](../../Organizations/ZeNa/ZeNa%20City%20Council.md). By all accounts a kind and thoughtful person. They lead weekly sermons in [Cōsh](../Gods/Cōsh.md)'s name, and provide various other religious services (funerals, individual blessings, curse removals, weddings, etc.) most days, albeit with a decently long waiting list.

Has a personal assistant by the name of [Felix Rhodes](Felix%20Rhodes). Felix isn't a follower of Cōsh, but that's not a requirement, and he must be good at his job, else he wouldn't have gotten to such a high position so quickly.
