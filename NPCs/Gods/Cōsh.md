(They/Them) The [Titanite](IPoK%20Wiki/Locations/Titan.md) god of the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and the Sky, and the most revered god in the [Kingdom of Titania](Kingdom%20of%20Titania), considered to be the most powerful. Legends say that when you hear a crack of thunder, it's the sound of Cōsh destroying evil with their mighty hammer. They also say this same hammer is what made the crater that Titan now rests in.

Cōsh has a major sect in [[ZeNa]] called the [[Sentinels of the Celestial Dome]].
