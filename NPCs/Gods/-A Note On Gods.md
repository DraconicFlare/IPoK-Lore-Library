Gods, in this setting, are the product of collective belief. Each god starts as a local spirit, usually by committing a name to a force of nature or a dark shape seen from afar. As that being becomes more believed, they grow more powerful, and become that thing they were believed to be. Being that the nature of a god is much more... fluid, than in many settings, Clerics, Paladins, and Warlocks alike might share the same entity as their source of power, the main difference being the way in which power is granted to them.

It has been theorized by religious scholars that some gods could be in the collective consciousness for long enough to have a level of circular, self-perpetuating belief, such that they might gain a level of independence from that belief and could survive without any outside influence. It is further theorized that something similar is the cause for this plane's existence, and in turn, the existence of all planes; some sort of god from outside the known universe became untethered from its source and created a new world. All that being said, no proof of a secret "elder god" has ever been found, so this remains a fairly fringe belief.

On the other hand, more local gods, i.e. patron deities of a household or town, might only grant the full strength of their power to clerics (and such) while those practitioners stay within the deity's domain of belief, and their powers might lessen the further they stray from their deity's homeland.
