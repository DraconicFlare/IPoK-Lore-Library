The twin connected cities of Zenith and Nadir, colloquially nicknamed ZeNa. The former, a semicircular, walled city, rests against the side of the [Wyrmspine](Wyrmspine) mountains. It is a city of trade, exporting [blue ash](blue%20ash) wood, [red steel](red%20steel), and brimstone. The high supply of materials has made it into a popular spot for craftsmen, a source of magical reagents for brewers and spellcasters, and a shopping hub for travelers with an eye for sturdy arms and armor.

The latter sits in a roughly circular chasm at the apex of that semicircle, known colloquially as [the Rift](the%20Rift). Though, to say it rests in the chasm is somewhat inaccurate; The Rift is a portal to the plane of [Tartarus](Tartarus), a dark and ominous plane full of unseen monsters, but also the [demon](demon) and [devil](devil) races. The plane is like a massive cave system, full of tunnels and openings, with yawning chasms ending in pools of lava. This is where Zenith's trade comes from.

Zenith and Nadir are connected by magic portal and by trade, and in many ways operate as a single unit; Nadir is where the average laborer lives, where the average laborer sleeps, and where a large number of laborers work. Zenith is where the steel foundries are, where the raw materials are made into goods to sell, where things are sold, and where the people with money live. It's not exactly a fair distribution, and those who benefit most from it seek to keep it that way, and those that are harmed most seek to change things. Those in the middle mostly tend to keep their heads down.

As far as cities go, ZeNa is very young. It was only officially founded in the year {gamestart-24}, but its rapid growth stems from two factors: firstly, that it sprung up from the shell of the town of [Needlepit](Needlepit), so there was already a baseline population, and secondly, that it rapidly became a trade hub due to its permanent portal to Tartarus, transforming the small town into what essentially amounts to a port city.

The history of ZeNa begins in the small town of Needlepit. The town was often overlooked and forgotten about, which suited its residents fine. The closest city to it, [Titan](Titan.md), was fairly insular too, and made few overtures towards the smaller town, other than giving occasional aid when a villager managed to get themselves injured in a way their non-magical medicine would be too slow to heal.

Then, in {gamestart-50}, a traveler came to town by the name of [Caelbyrn](Caelbyrn). He claimed to be simply passing through, but it quickly became clear that he had more dire intentions in mind.

Within a year, he had built a tower in the center of town. The villagers could do little to stop his sudden interest in architecture, as he had demonstrated that he was no stranger to magic, and Caelbyrn prayed on their preexisting fear of it.

A year after that, his experiments began. Villagers would disappear in the night, and demonic figures began prowling the streets around Caelbyrn's tower. Any dissent or escape attempts would only increase the disappearances.

Ten years after he arrived, a small band of adventurers stopped briefly in town, looking for shelter and a soft bed before they made their way to Titan. By the time they arrived, the population of Needlepit was cut in half. They were attacked by Caelbyrn's minions, and only one of them survived the encounter, running for the capitol. Knowing that his secret was out, the wizard prepared for battle...

Less than a week later, [Ser Jadia Arden](Ser%20Jadia%20Arden) led a small battalion of [earth genasi](earth%20genasi) soldiers into Needlepit. Upon their arrival, however, Caelbyrn revealed his master plan â€” a ritual which, once activated, would open a portal directly to the source of his demonic warriors: Tartarus. The portal itself tore a massive chasm into the earth, swallowing two-thirds of the town and a not insignificant percentage of the army. 

Ser Arden survived, however, and climbed the tower to find Caelbyrn. She struck him down in battle, but in doing so triggered a magical failsafe, killing her as well. The soldiers were able to clear out the remaining demonic threat, and the day was saved. Without the wizard's active channeling into the rift, it closed part-way, and the genasi were able to construct simple walls and fortifications. 

Five years later, the genasi had made a home for themselves in the town. Demons continued to pour from the rift periodically, felling civilians and soldiers alike, and an army presence was needed to keep the town alive. Needlepit began to expand to house a larger compliment of soldiers, and when their posts became permanent, many moved their families as well. Traveling mages and alchemists (hopefully, with better intent than Caelbyrn) began coming from afar, hearing that there was a large supply of demonic corpses coming from this town, and therefore there would be access to certain reagents they couldn't get elsewhere. A business was made of killing these invaders. And then the attacks... stopped.

And exactly one year after they stopped, a single devil walked out from the portal. He had come to make a deal with the people there. Rather than both sides constantly fighting and dying and reinforcing, let both sides grow stronger together, with peace. This devil was now-[Arkhai Scau](../NPCs/ZeNa/Arkhai%20Scau.md).

After speaking at length with the town's overseer on behalf of [the King of Titan](the%20King%20of%20Titan), [Roscoe Stromkirk](Roscoe%20Stromkirk), the two forged the [Stromkirk-Scau Accord](Stromkirk-Scau%20Accord), and peace was made.

The town, now for the most part absent of demon corpses, had to find a new industry. Tartarus provided; their silvery ore could be smelted into an alloy stronger than steel, and the wood from their trees proved sturdier than any lumber from the [Material Plane](Material%20Plane). The city was revitalized again, renamed, and rebuilt as two connected cities: Zenith, and Nadir.
