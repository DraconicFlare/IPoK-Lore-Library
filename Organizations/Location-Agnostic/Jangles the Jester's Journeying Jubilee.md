A travelling one-ring circus (also known by its members as 4J), which is, at game-start, sitting just north of the western gate of [ZeNa](../../Locations/ZeNa.md). The circus hasn't been in town for long, two weeks at most, but no one can quite remember when they got here.

The origin of 4J is somewhat hazy, some saying it made its start in [Titan](../../Locations/Titan.md), others say it hails from a kingdom outside Titania, still others claim it's from the depths of [Tartarus](Tartarus) itself. They tend not to quiet any rumors, as the mystique adds to their performance.

There are seven members of 4J, all of whom are only known by their stage names. They are as follows:

- Jangles the jester: the ringleader of the circus, also acting as clown(slapstick comedy) and jester(on-the-fly japes)
- Steele, the living foundry: a partly mechanical(?) man with the ability to ingest metal and transform it into sculpture
- Physi, the strongman: an exceptionally strong person who often performs feats such as bending steel with bare hands, smashing through genasi-made stone walls, etc. Sibling to Psych
- Psych, the blade: a knife juggler and thrower, whose blades are psychic projections. Also has a pre-show fortune-teller booth. Sister to Physi.
- Briiz, the acrobat: a flying trapeze artist, whose main gimmick is his seemingly random shifts from place to place, swinging off one trapeze onto another, and then vanishing, reappearing in the air and being caught by another. Every show is slightly different
- Kestra, the walking musicbox: responsible for all the music during the show, due to an incredible magical propensity towards replicating the sounds of instruments. Doesn't have an act herself.
- The Great Visio, illusionist extraordinaire: performs very rarely, but is a master magician. Most of his work is creating illusionary images of what appears in the center, to project it to a larger audience.
