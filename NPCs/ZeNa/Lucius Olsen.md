(He/Him) The tiefling mayor of Nadir, and member of the [ZeNa City Council](../../Organizations/ZeNa/ZeNa%20City%20Council.md). Very outspoken about the rights of [Tartarus](Tartarus) people, and affiliated heavily with the [Chains of Carceri](../../Organizations/ZeNa/Chains%20of%20Carceri.md), which has caused some trouble for him in the past; the nobility of [ZeNa](../../Locations/ZeNa.md) don't care terribly for sharing a council chamber with someone who wants their wealth redistributed to the working class.
