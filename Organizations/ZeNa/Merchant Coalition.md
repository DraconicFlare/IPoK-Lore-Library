An organization initially founded on the good ideals of merchant protections, but has devolved into a protection racket. In order to run a business in Zenith, you have to pay a fee to the Guildmaster, monthly rent (also taken in by the Coalition, and then given to the city. With a small fee on top, of course, for the trouble), and you have to be subject to certain specific standards of doing business. The last of these facts isn't inherently bad, but in addition to being able to keep rats out of the cooking, it does mean that to some extent the Guildmaster can decide a business isn't up to snuff on a whim and have them closed down. This happens rarely, but not never.

The current Guildmaster of the Merchant Coalition is [Thaddeus Gilder](Thaddeus%20Gilder.md), an elf who arrived in [Needlepit](Needlepit) during the initial trade boom, mustered through the year of monetary drought, and rode those waves of commerce to eventually become a local trade mogul.
